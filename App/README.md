This is a Visual Studio project.

To use it, you need the Xamarin extension and ZXing library.

### Project structure:
- QR2Web.sln is the solution to open with Visual Studio
- QR2Web is the folder containing the different projects
  - QR2Web is the shared project
  - QR2Web.iOS is the iOS project
  - QR2Web.UWP is the Windows (desktop and windows phone) project
  - QR2Web.Droid is the Android project

I was trying to put everything on the shared project.
