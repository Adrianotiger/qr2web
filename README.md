### What is QR2Web?
QR to web is a simple barcodescanner with integrated browser.
The webpage can interact with the browser to start a barcode scanner or to light up the flashlight of your phone.

The app is useful if you are a webpage developer and want to <b>integrate a barcode scanner in your webpage</b>.

### Why this project?
You find always more QR codes on the web and it is also easy to generate QR codes for own projects. Good smartphones are able to scan a QR codes directly from a webpage. This app just integrates the camera and flashlight ability for a more professional app. It is fully customizable: you can remove any app menu o navigation bar, so that the page seems to be an application.

This app is a simple QR scanner that will start over a simple link on the web. Once the scan is over, the app will forward the code to your webpage. 

So you need to write a webpage and give this free app to your users. **You don't need to write any app for this functionality anymore**, only the webpage.

### On which smartphone does it works?
The project was made with Maui and ZXing library. So it works with Android (>8.1), Windows (10) and iOS (>10).
Because I don't have any developer account on iOS, I can give only the Windows Store link and Android Play link. Maybe in future someone will compile and upload this app on the store for iOS.
