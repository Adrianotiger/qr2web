### Why this project?
You find always more QR codes on the web and it is also easy to generate QR codes for own projects. Good smartphones (with Android or Windows Mobile) are able to scan a QR code directly from a webpage. Older smartphones and cheaper smartphones need an app because they are not able to access the camera from the webpage. So you need an app for each OS (=> store accounts, developer accounts, and $$$).

This app is a simple QR scanner that will start over a simple link on the web. Once the scan is over, the app will forward the code to your webpage. 

So you need to write a webpage and give this free app to your users. **You don't need to write any app for this functionality anymore**, only the webpage.

### On which smartphone does it works?
The project was made with Xamarin and ZXing library. So it works with Android (>4.1), Windows (10) and iOS (>7).
Because I don't have any developer account on iOS, I can give only the Windows Store link and Android Play link. Maybe in future someone will compile and upload this app on the store for iOS.
