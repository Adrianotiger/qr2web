                <h3>How to use this app</h3>
                This app is not a normal QR-reader, so if you downloaded it to "parse" a code, this is definitively the wrong app!<br>
                This app need to be a part of a bigger project. Useful if you read barcodes for your inventory for example.<br>
                Once the barcode was read, the app will forward this code to a webpage, this page can be your personal inventory home page or an external page. You define it in the settings.<br>
                <br>
                So, once opened the app and after setting the destination home page, you can begin to use the app:<br>
                click on the barcode button to scan (the scan can also be started automatically from the webpage).<br>
                After the scan is over, the internet page will receive your code and something can be done.<br>
                <b>That's it!</b> this application is able to do this, not more ;)
                <br><br>
                If you are a developer, go to the home page to see how develop a webpage for this app (so that you can get the parsed QR code through the app).
              </p>
              <p id='config'>
                <hr>
                <h3>Configuration</h3>
                Click on "..." to open an extended menu and then "Settings". Now you can set some options for the app:<br>
                <h4>Home Page</h4>
                This is the page that will be loaded, once the app is started. This is the most important setting, because the data will be forwarded to this page.
                <h4>Emulation</h4>
                The app is able to emulate other apps (from Android and Apple world) - it is in a beta phase. If something doesn't work correctly, write me a mail or post a message in the forum.
                <h4>Barcodes</h4>
                Even if it was born as QR reader to be faster, you can select also other barcodes types.
                <h4>Portrait mode</h4>
                Will force the app to stay in portrait and not rotate the webpage if you rotate the phone.
                <h4>Save history</h4>
                Every scan will be stored for a future use (up to 16 entries). Helpfull if you are offline when scanning the QR code.
                <h4>App Language</h4>
                Select between english, german and italian.

                <h3>Mocha/pic2Shop emulation</h3>
                Always the same story... A nice app, but only available on the Play store or iTunes.<br>
                I implemented a little emulation for this 2 apps. If you open a mochasoft protocol or a pic2shop pro protocol on a webpage, this app will try to send them the data like the real app.<br>
                I can't grant the funtionality at 100% but if you discover a wrong parsing of the data you can write me or write a post in the blog.<br>
                Mocha example (should open the mochasoft page with the parsed code): 
                <a href='mochabarcode://CALLBACK=http://mochasoft.com/test3.htm'>mochabarcode://CALLBACK= http://mochasoft.com/test3.htm</a><br>
                readbarcode:// to scan to a function (calls onscan(BARCODE) on your webpage) or mochabarcode://RUN is also accepted.<br>
                Pic2Shop Pro example: 
                <a href='p2spro://scan?'>p2spro://scan?</a><br>
                will scan the code and insert it into the webpage with the default home page. You can set also callback URLs, like the original app.<br>
                As wrote, this app only emulate the functionality and is not a porting or a copy of the app, so it could not work like expected.<br>
                <b>The protocols (mochabarcode, p2spro and readbarcode) are implemented, so that there is at least 1 app in the store able to parse the codes with those protocols :D</b>
